**Customer Segmentation with KNN and RFM Analysis**

This repository implements customer segmentation using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis technique. 

**Project Goals:**

* Segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.
* Identify high-value, medium-value, and low-value customer segments using RFM scores.
* Leverage KNN to classify new customers into existing segments.

**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: This folder contains the customer data used for analysis (replace with your data file name and format).
* `CLV & RFM-2.ipynb`: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks or scripts for data preparation, KNN implementation, RFM analysis, and visualization (replace with your notebook file names and format).
* `README.md`: This file (you are currently editing it).

**Dependencies:**

This project requires the following Python libraries (you can install them using `pip install <library_name>`):

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn

**Running the Project:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries (mentioned above) in your development environment.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder (or your chosen script execution method). 
5. The results will be saved in the `output/` folder.

**Further Exploration:**

* Experiment with different K values for the KNN algorithm.
* Explore alternative customer segmentation techniques.
* Implement visualization tools to better understand the characteristics of each segment.

**Feel free to modify this README.md file to reflect the specific details of your project and include any additional information you'd like to share.**

**Note:**

* Replace the bracketed information with your specific details (data file name, notebook file names, etc.).
* Consider adding screenshots or visualizations from your analysis to enhance the README.
* If you used any specific sources or tutorials, you can mention them in the README for reference.
